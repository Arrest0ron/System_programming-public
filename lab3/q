       ATTR_LIST is a comma-separated list of attributes. Attributes are 'mode' for permissions (including any ACL and xattr permissions), 'ownership' for user and group, 'timestamps' for file timestamps,
       'links' for hard links, 'context' for security context, 'xattr' for extended attributes, and 'all' for all attributes.

       By  default,  sparse SOURCE files are detected by a crude heuristic and the corresponding DEST file is made sparse as well.  That is the behavior selected by [1m--sparse[22m=[4mauto[24m.  Specify [1m--sparse[22m=[4malways[0m
       to create a sparse DEST file whenever the SOURCE file contains a long enough sequence of zero bytes.  Use [1m--sparse[22m=[4mnever[24m to inhibit creation of sparse files.

       UPDATE controls which existing files in the destination are replaced.  'all' is the default operation when an [1m--update [22moption is not specified, and results in all existing files in the  destination
       being  replaced.   'none'  is similar to the [1m--no-clobber [22moption, in that no files in the destination are replaced, but also skipped files do not induce a failure.  'older' is the default operation
       when [1m--update [22mis specified, and results in files being replaced if they're older than the corresponding source file.

       When [1m--reflink[22m[=[4malways[24m] is specified, perform a lightweight copy, where the data blocks are copied only when modified.  If this is not possible the copy fails, or if  [1m--reflink[22m=[4mauto[24m  is  specified,
       fall back to a standard copy.  Use [1m--reflink[22m=[4mnever[24m to ensure a standard copy is performed.

       The  backup suffix is '~', unless set with [1m--suffix [22mor SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected via the [1m--backup [22moption or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.
       Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if [1m--backup [22mis given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As a special case, cp makes a backup of SOURCE when the force and backup options are given and SOURCE and DEST are the same name for an existing, regular file.
